  <h1>Why I Run</h1>
  
  <p>
    Since the beginning of my memories, I have always felt like I have limitless energy, of course I do not. But this youthful "invincibility" has and does play a big part in why I run. I mean, how else can I stem a hyper active mind and violent appetite?
  <p>
    Throughout my under graduate days I could often be found in the college gym, pumping iron after or before a class. This worked well for me at that time. Quick and efficient, with positive mental benefits. Nothing like some heavy compound exercises to dispel some pent up energy.
  <p>
    This became boring. The challenge was gone and I found myself "turning up" to phone some reps in. It was in post graduate school that one day I pondered, I haven't run in awhile, maybe I should give it ago? 2 miles later, a buckled, panting and sweaty mess on the side of the road. This was the challenge I had been looking for. I knew that with running I had all my work in front of me, and that was very appealing.
  <p>
    I spent about a year running 3 times per week, slowly getting my legs battle ready. Then, a tragedy happened in my personal life. I responded by using running as a positive tool to manage the grief. I also wanted to make some kind of difference in the world. This sparked the fire to train and run the Dublin Marathon, raising money for a spectacular charity, the <a href="https://rnli.org/">RNLI</a>. In the end, through amazing support, I  ran a total of 1593.52 km in 5 months training for the Marathon and raised â‚¬4,530.74 <a href="https://sse-airtricity-dublin-marathon-2018.everydayhero.com/ie/conan">for the RNLI</a>.

    This is one of the best things that I have done. When I started my running adventures, I never thought I would be led down the path to a Marathon, but am grateful that I was. The positive benefits of running are huge, there is hardly any downside. Running has now become apart of who I am and not just what I do. I owe a lot to running.

    I now run as many times as possible every week, I log all of my runs on Strava, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/17590055">please add and follow me</a>
