user_description: <p>I am an innovative Scientist with vast and deep experience, wildly curious. Lately I have been immersed in <b>quality assurance engineering</b> working for <a href="https://www.theprojectgroup.com/en/">The Project Group</a>, a Munich headquartered company creating project, portfolio and resource management software. I'm behind all the QA related processes for 4 products.</p> <p>I have over 5 yearâ€™s experience in managing international projects with a complex nature. I have very strong technical abilities in novel electrochemical biosensor research that includes embedded systems programming. During my Ph.D I acquired very strong skills in public speaking, data analysis and project management. I have a proven ability to apply engineering principles and techniques to solve a variety of scientific problems.</p>
